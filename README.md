## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install ultralytics torch torchvision opencv-python matplotlib
```

### Using the Pre-trained Model

You can load the model directly from Hugging Face:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load model from Hugging Face
model = YOLO('https://huggingface.co/IsmatS/crop_desease_detection/resolve/main/best.pt')

# Or use the model ID
model = YOLO('IsmatS/crop_desease_detection')

# Run inference
results = model('path/to/your/image.jpg')

# Process results
for result in results:
    boxes = result.boxes
    if boxes is not None:
        for box in boxes:
            confidence = box.conf[0]
            bbox = box.xyxy[0]
            print(f"Unhealthy tree detected with {confidence:.2f} confidence")

# Save annotated image
results[0].save('result.jpg')

## 📊 Understanding Training Metrics

### Overall Performance

Your model achieved excellent results:
- **93.3% mAP50** - Primary accuracy metric for object detection
- **65.9% mAP50-95** - Stricter accuracy measure using multiple IoU thresholds
- **87.8% Precision** - When detecting a diseased tree, the model is correct 87.8% of the time
- **86.3% Recall** - The model finds 86.3% of all diseased trees in images
- **Training Time**: 24.5 minutes on NVIDIA A100-40GB GPU

### Training Progress Analysis

#### Loss Metrics Breakdown

The training process tracked three types of losses that decreased over 50 epochs:

1. **Box Loss (box_loss)**: 3.371 → 1.117
   - Measures bounding box coordinate prediction accuracy
   - Lower values indicate better localization of diseased trees

2. **Classification Loss (cls_loss)**: 2.346 → 0.6453
   - Measures object classification accuracy
   - Significant reduction shows improved disease identification

3. **DFL Loss (Distribution Focal Loss)**: 2.348 → 1.072
   - Helps with precise bounding box regression
   - Steady decrease indicates better boundary detection

#### Evaluation Metrics Evolution

- **mAP50**: Improved from 28.8% (epoch 1) to 93.3% (final)
  - Mean Average Precision at 50% IoU threshold
  - Primary accuracy metric for object detection

- **mAP50-95**: Rose from 12% to 65.9%
  - Average mAP for IoU thresholds from 50% to 95%
  - More stringent metric; 65.9% is excellent

- **Precision**: Reached 87.8%
  - True positives / (True positives + False positives)
  - Low false positive rate

- **Recall**: Achieved 86.3%
  - True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
  - Finds most diseased trees in images

### Training Characteristics

1. **Fast Initial Learning**: Major improvements in first 10 epochs
2. **Stable Plateau**: Performance stabilized around epochs 20-30
3. **Fine-tuning Phase**: Gradual improvements in final epochs
4. **No Overfitting**: Validation metrics continued improving throughout

### Model Efficiency

- **Inference Speed**: ~7ms per image on GPU
- **Model Size**: 11.1M parameters (lightweight)
- **Batch Processing**: 16 images per batch at 640x640 resolution

### Dataset Insights

The model was trained on:
- **Training**: 4,536 images (3,206 with diseased trees, 1,330 healthy backgrounds)
- **Validation**: 567 images (399 with diseased trees, 168 backgrounds)
- **Test**: 567 images (390 with diseased trees, 177 backgrounds)

Background images help the model learn to distinguish healthy from diseased trees, reducing false positives.

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Custom Inference Settings

```python
# Adjust detection parameters
results = model.predict(
    source='path/to/image.jpg',
    conf=0.25,  # Confidence threshold
    iou=0.45,   # IoU threshold for NMS
    imgsz=640,  # Inference size
    save=True   # Save results
)
```

### Batch Processing

```python
import glob

# Process multiple images
image_paths = glob.glob('path/to/images/*.jpg')
results = model(image_paths, batch=8)

# Process results
for i, result in enumerate(results):
    print(f"Image {i}: Detected {len(result.boxes)} unhealthy trees")
    result.save(f'result_{i}.jpg')
```

### API Usage

You can also use the model through the Hugging Face Inference API:

```python
import requests

API_URL = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/IsmatS/crop_desease_detection"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_HF_TOKEN"}

def query(filename):
    with open(filename, "rb") as f:
        data = f.read()
    response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, data=data)
    return response.json()

output = query("your_image.jpg")
```
